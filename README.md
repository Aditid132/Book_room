Planning to make a recommendation app/bot for reading a good book.

Develop a recommendation system for the users of the library. The users should get personalized recommendations based on the information of previous readings. Information like reading patterns, authors, reading style, and book read status, rating, similar interest/topics, etc. can be used as input to give recommendations.

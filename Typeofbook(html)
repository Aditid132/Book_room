      <h2><u>Type of books</u></h2>
      Do you have a favorite type of book, either fiction or nonfiction? Are you
      thinking about branching out and enjoying a new genre? If so, a list of
      book types or genres can help you choose what to read next. See if any of
      the below subtypes catch your eye.
      <h3><u>Two Different Types of Books</u></h3>
      <p>
        All books are classified as either fiction or nonfiction. Within these
        two types of books, you’ll find dozens of more specific types, or genres
      </p>
      <h4><u>Nonfiction Books</u></h4>
      Nonfiction books contain factual information, such as biographies and
      history books.<br />

      Examples of nonfiction books include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Most biographies are nonfiction. We say "most" biographies, because a
          biography of a fictional character is really a fictional book.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Diary of Anne Frank is nonfiction and a journal, making it a
          nonfiction journal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most Dictionaries and encyclopedias are nonfiction because they
          contain facts about words.
        </li>
        <li>Travel books such as an atlas are nonfiction.</li>
        <li>
          "How to” books that teach real skills, like the classic Betty Crocker
          Cookbook are considered factual.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4><u>Fiction Books</u></h4>
      Fiction books contain a story that the author made up, such as romance or
      children's books. The most commonly read works are works of fiction.
      Perhaps some of their elements are based on hints of truth, but they have
      been elaborated, fabricated, and used to embellish into a new story.<br />

      Some examples of classic fiction books are :
      <ul>
        <li>The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway</li>
        <li>To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee</li>
        <li>Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston</li>
      </ul>
